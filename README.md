# Personal Portfolio Website

## 1. Project Objective
The goal of this project is to design and develop a fully responsive personal portfolio website using HTML5 and CSS3. This website serves as a digital resume to showcase my profile, skills, and projects in a clean, professional, and interactive "techie" interface.

    * **Home:** A hero section with an animated introduction and a "Download Resume" button.
    * **About:** A personal bio and a grid of technical skills.
    * **Projects:** A responsive grid of project cards for "Credit Card Fraud Detection" and "Tunify."
    * **Contact:** A functional `mailto:` contact form and social media links.
